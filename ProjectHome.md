# Why? #
Imagine you open a file with [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) suggestions or warnings or errors and doubt whether the tool is correct.

You may **feel** the suggestions are ok - but if you want to become a better developer, you need to **understand the reason** behind them. Otherwise the tool will be smarter than you ;)

(It works the other way around too. Smart people are often good mentors, and you may want to share your knowledge about some R# suggestion - just because someone else might be struggling with the same issue right now.)

So, _Whysharper_ provides an easy and natural way for sharing and learning.

# How? #
With the plugin installed, there's a new option added to every R# suggestion:

> <img src='http://codevanced.net/image.axd?picture=2009%2f8%2fwhy-can-be-static.png' border='1' width='380' height='106' />

> <img src='http://codevanced.net/image.axd?picture=2009%2f8%2fwhy-redundant-catch.png' width='380' height='188' />


After you hit the "why" you'll get a link or two with decent discussions. Just read over and you'll understand why you may need a change.

# What's next? #
It's a community tool and it's **you**, the user, who will make it shine.

A lot of R# suggestions don't have links to the explanations yet - and existing ones might be unavailable or outdated.

If you come across a dead link or know a worthwhile discussion about a particular issue, feel free to [open a bug](http://code.google.com/p/whysharper/issues/entry). After your suggestion is applied, **it will become visible to all _Whysharper_ users** next time they restart Visual Studio.
