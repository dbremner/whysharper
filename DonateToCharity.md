I created _Whysharper_ in my spare time, and it was relatively easy to do. And also I'm paid handsomely well in my daily job.

So I don't expect any money from this project.

However, if you like it - you still can donate. **All money would go to a charity.** Add up a few points to your karma (and to my karma!) and help people in need. Sounds like a fair deal.
